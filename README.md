Hello.

There are a couple of plugins out there to compile
Google Protobuf files, but most of them end up
giving NPEs, so you have to fallback to Exec Plugin.

That's why I wanted to create a quite simple plugin
that just does the job. Plus the source code is very
small and simple to fix any possible issue.
